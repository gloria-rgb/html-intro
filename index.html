    <p>Hi there, i am from Anambra, Nigeria. I like to think of myself as a 'kwechiri' kind i.e someone who does not give up. It could be moving slow like a tortoise but never stopping. i love food so much that it made me love to cook. I am passionate about web developmentnwhich is why i joined the genesys upskill program. I enjoy learning new things,meeting people and taking on challenges that help me grow both personally and professionally. I believe in staying positive, working hard and of course, flexing life. </p>
